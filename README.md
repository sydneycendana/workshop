# Fullstack Airbnb Clone

Welcome to Workshop! I built this idea with the frustrating experience I had when moving to a new city. As a fully remote worker and student, I struggled to find the best places to work from to get out of my house. Yelp was too overwhelming and not giving me the information I was looking for. With Workshop, you can search for places near you and see what they are rated in terms of wifi quality, pet-friendliness, and noise level. Here is the link to the <a href="https://sc-workshop.onrender.com/" target="_blank">live site</a>.

## Introduction

Creating my first fullstack application was a thrilling undertaking for me as a new developer. This project challenged me to push my skills to the limit and learn new technologies and techniques. I spent countless hours debugging and reading documentation, and encountered many mishaps that I can now look back on with pride.

The end result is an engaging application that I'm excited to share with the world. With Home Hopper, users can browse and interact with different homes as if through a familiar and intuitive interface.
